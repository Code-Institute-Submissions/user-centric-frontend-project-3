#  My Resume Website

The aim of this website is to present myself to potential employers professionally and showcase my abilities as a front end developer.
The website itself will be pretty basic at this stage but will include more over time as my abilities grow.


## wireframes

The wireframes.pdf is in the assets/wireframes folder.

I changed a lot from my initial wireframes procedurally during the development, 
it took a lot of time testing better layouts and I learned the importance of a well thought out initial wireframe.

Initially I changed the heading into a regular bootstrap nav, then I made a custom hovering slidebar, later on as my abilities increased I made the centralised unfolding Home nav.
