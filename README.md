#  My Resume Website

The aim of this website is to present myself to potential employers in the best light and showcase my abilities as a front end developer.
The website itself will be pretty basic at this stage but will provide an easy interface with contextual content for potential employers and assessors to see, 
however on my portfolio page I will showcase more advanced projects later on in the course.
