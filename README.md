#  My Resume Website

The aim of this website is to present myself to potential employers in the best light and showcase my abilities as a front end developer.
The website itself will be pretty basic to provide an easy-to-read interface and no-nonsense content for the potential employers to read, 
however on my portfolio page I will showcase more advanced projects which I will add later in the course.
